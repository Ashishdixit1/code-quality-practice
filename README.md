# Code Quality Practice

Welcome to the Code Quality Practice repository! This repository is dedicated to practicing JUnit and improving code quality through test-driven development (TDD) principles. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn unit testing or an experienced developer aiming to enhance your testing skills, this repository is for you.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to provide a platform for practicing JUnit tests and exploring various aspects of code quality improvement. By engaging in test-driven development practices, we aim to:

- Enhance understanding of unit testing concepts.
- Learn how to write effective test cases using JUnit.
- Improve code quality and maintainability through rigorous testing.
- Foster collaboration and knowledge sharing among developers.

## Getting Started

To get started with practicing JUnit tests, follow these steps:

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd code-quality-practice
    ```

3. Explore the existing test cases and code examples in the `src/test` directory.

4. Add your own test cases or modify existing ones to practice writing JUnit tests.

5. Run the tests using your preferred build tool (e.g., Maven, Gradle) or IDE to verify their correctness.

6. Experiment with different testing scenarios and refactor the code to improve code quality.

7. Collaborate with others by contributing to the repository or discussing testing strategies in the Issues section.
